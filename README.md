# comparative-analysis-of-classification-models


This repository contains a comparative analysis of various machine learning models and techniques used for solving different types of data science problems. The objective is to compare the effectiveness, accuracy, and computational efficiency of different models and identify the best-suited model for specific tasks.

## Project Overview

The project involves evaluating the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms on different datasets. The performance is measured using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrices**. The project aims to provide a detailed comparison of various models to help choose the best model for different types of problems.

### Key Objectives:
- Compare multiple classification and regression models.
- Evaluate models based on performance metrics.
- Visualise model performance through various charts and graphs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis and experimentation

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in `/notebooks` to explore the analysis and model comparisons.

## Results
